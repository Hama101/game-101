3. Run dockerized server:

   docker-compose up

4. After docker image is built and server started, setup migrations/static files/admin access:

   docker-compose exec app sh entrypoint.sh

## Manual setup ##

    2. Set PROJECT_NAME, FRONTEND_URL
    3. Set local DB credentials
    6. Set admin credentials for script or setup them manually later
2. Set docker-compose.override.yml file:
    1. By default all non-core services (db , ...) are placed remotely, in this case no
       docker-compose.override.yml is needed
    2. To place some services locally add docker-compose.override.yml
3. Run dockerized server: docker-compose up --build
4. After docker image is built and server started, setup migrations/static files/admin access:
    the entrypoint.sh will handel server setup
